# Alephium-task

This project is a simple Node.js script that uses the Alephium web3 library to check the balance of a given Alephium address on the testnet. To run this script, you need to have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

First, clone the repository or download the script. Open a terminal in the directory containing the script and install the required dependencies by running:

```
npm install @alephium/web3
```

Open the script `index.js` in a text editor and ensure that the `receiver` variable contains the Alephium address you want to check the balance for. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script and run:

```
node index.js
```
You will have the balance of an address you provided!
